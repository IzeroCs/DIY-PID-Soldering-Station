# DIY-PID-Soldering-Station

Soldering Iron/Heat Gun Controller

To do:

> ## General
>  - [ ] Fix Issue with Having Encoder to Adjust (not enough interrupts, mostly related to AVR and PIC) 
>  - [ ] Fix the shunt resistor placement
>  - [ ] Fix the PWM pins
>  - [ ] Remove External x-tall (Atmega8 - can also change to 8mhz value but personally don't see point.)
>  - [ ] Also Fix Versioning

>## [x] (AVR) Standalone Schematics

>  - [x] Temperature NTCs
>  - [x] Stand Idling Interrupt
>  - [x] ICSP Header for programming
>  - [ ] Board Layout

===========================================

>## [ ] (AVR) Arduino Schematics
>  - [ ] Temprature NTCs
>  - [ ] Stand Idling Interrupt
>  - [ ] Shield Layout

===========================================

>## [ ] (AVR) Arduino Code
>  - [x] PID Algorithm
>  - [x] I2C Character Display
>  - [ ] PID Calibration
>  - [ ] PID Double Config (More aggressive PID at low temps)
>  - [ ] Menu Function
>  - [ ] PID Auto Calibration Algorithm
>  - [ ] Power Calculation (Shunt Resistor)
>  - [ ] Support for 2nd equipment (potentially objective for PID)
